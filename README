This is a repo for random bits and pieces of canvas animation and
sprites I'm working on.

Since I'm undeniably bad at finishing big projects on my own, I'm going
to start working on little ones that I can finish in an afternoon or
over a few days. These are going to be modular components which can be
clipped together into a bigger project in the future should I wish.

Naturally, you're free to use these in your own project if you find them
useful enough.
